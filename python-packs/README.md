# Python Packages
Quick list of some of my favorite, and or necessary evil, packages.
## Twitter
#### Tweepy
Very easy to use for interacting with Twitter.

`pip install tweepy==3.6.0`

## Telegram
#### python-telegram-bot
Default go to for Telegram bots

`pip install python-telegram-bot`

## Database
#### SQLAlchemy (ORM)
Best (if not the only, well known) stand alone ORM for Python. Honestly I would love to find anything better. I'd die for something as refined as Djangos ORM and Migration set up.

`pip install SQLAlchemy`
#### Alembic (DB Migrations)
If using SQLAlchemy might as used the tool written by the same guy for migrations right? I die just a bit on the inside using either....

`pip install alembic`
